            ### Hi, I'm Akshay 👋 \
            I build foundational Python tools for developers who work with data. \
            - 💻 I'm currently working on [marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo), a new kind of reactive Python notebook. \
            - 🔭 I developed [PyMDE](https://github.com/cvxgrp/pymde), a PyTorch library for computing custom embeddings of large datasets. \
            - 🖩 I'm a maintainer and developer of [CVXPY](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy), a widely-used library for mathematical optimization. \
            - 📚 I love writing. I write [blog posts](https://www.debugmind.com/2020/01/04/paths-to-the-future-a-year-at-google-brain/), research [papers](https://www.akshayagrawal.com/), and books, including a [book on embeddings](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/min_dist_emb.html). \
            - 🎓 I graduated from Stanford University with a PhD, advised by [Stephen Boyd](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/index.html). All my papers are accompanied by open-source software. \
            I'm always open to conversations. Reach me via [email](mailto:akshay@marimo.io). \
            ``` \
            The generated Markdown should be well-formatted and ready to be used in a GitHub profile README.

AGENT github-profile-updater
INSTRUCTION Given the generated Markdown profile summary, update the GitHub profile README with the new content. \
            Ensure that the README is updated in a way that it reflects the latest information about the user.
